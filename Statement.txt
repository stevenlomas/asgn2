Contributions
-------------
Steven Lomas: After setting up the project on my GitHub account and Grant uploading
the base classes, I authored the DepartingTrain, FreightCar, PassengerCar and
TrainGUI classes in their entirety. Grant and I both contributed equally when
authoring the RollingStock and TrainException classes, with Grant writing the
Locomotive class except for some minor changes by myself. I did not contribute in
any meaningful way to both the Test classes RollingStockTests and TrainTests.

Grant O'Meara: I completed the test classes (RollingStockTests.java and TrainTests.java)
as well as mostly creating the Locomotive class and working on an early version of
RollingStock that is significantly modified from my contribution as well as finishing off
the TrainException class.


GUI Editing
-----------
Steven Lomas: No third party tools were used outside of raw code in Eclipse.


Final Statement
---------------
I agree that this doccument, summarising contributions made during the development
of this project is correct and unbiased.
