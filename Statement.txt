Statement by the Team
---------------------

Since this is a group project, we want a statement from the team so that we know who did 
what. Write a short (well under 1 page) plain text document called statement.txt
containing the following information.

1 The names and student numbers of the team members. 
2 A (short!) summary of the contribution made by each team member. (Your program 
code should also contain appropriate comments indicating authorship.)
3 A (short!) explanation of what GUI editing tools you used, if any, for Part 2 of the 
assignment. (Recall from the instructions that a higher standard of user interface is 
expected from teams who used a GUI editor compared to those who didn’t. Either 
way, however, your solution must work within Eclipse.)
4 A statement that the summary is agreed by both students. 

(This is not the place to ask for special consideration or for lateness penalties to be 
waived – do that via email, with supporting evidence such as a medical certificate as 
usual.) 

The file must be in plain text format, not Microsoft Word, Libre Office, PDF or other such 
formats, so that it can be appended to the automatically-generated marking report.
