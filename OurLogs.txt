As part of the spec, you supposed to provide some evidence of your usage of source control 
systems. This is something which should be very light, and you should use the source control tools to help you. I will give very simple instructions for git; those using other tools should look at the help files for the equivalent. The easiest thing to do is to use the git log command. As far as I am concerned, take the output from this command, and copy and paste it into a text file called OurLogs.txt. A guide to usage may be found here:

I don’t think that it is necessary for our purposes for you to use the more sophisticated 
options.
